**Project Description**
This Tableau workbook provides an initial exploration of consumer sales trends in the United States. The analysis focuses on visualizing sales data to identify patterns and trends across various categories or regions (depending on your data).

Here are some additional options you can consider based on the specific focus of your analysis:

If you analyzed sales by product category: "... identify trends in consumer spending habits across different product categories."
If you focused on regional variations: "... explore how consumer sales patterns differ across various regions in the United States."
If you investigated sales over time: "... examine trends in consumer sales over a specific time period."
